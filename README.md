# Android-App-Controlled-RC-Car-using-Bluetooth-
Arduino Robot Cars which can be controlled using an Android App is developed using various components such as Arduino UNO, Bluetooth module HC-06, Motor Driver L298 N and Android device. The Arduino based will be controlled using an Android App wherein the communication between the car and Android device will take place by the Bluetooth module. First of all, we designed and interfaced the Arduino UNO with the Bluetooth module and the Motor driver L298 N. Appropriate battery power was provided to the all the components to power them. The Arduino IDE was used to develop the code to control the motors using Arduino. Various data bytes are sent for moving the car in forward, reverse, forward left, forward right, reverse left and reverse right. For the developing and interfacing the components we studied various literatures and discussed on it. We studied the data sheets for the components such as Arduino UNO, Motor driver L298 N and Bluetooth Module HC-06. Then we interfaced the Arduino UNO with the Motor driver and Bluetooth module. We code which was developed using the Arduino IDE is uploaded into the Arduino UNO. We added some new attributes later which enhanced the working of Arduino controlled car. Also we applied various methods to reduce data redundancy and data inconsistency. And finally we did the testing of our Arduino based RC Car.
